> Emily Dickinson was a textbook recluse. She spoke to visitors through doors, gave treats to local children by lowering a basket from a second-story window and listened to her father's funeral from the privacy of her bedroom.

This is my bucket for lowering tweets to local children from my second-story window.

Less rudely, I was seeking a Twitter client that would be strictly write-only, allowing me to tweet but not to read tweets or interact with people. Some days I need to be able to say something but delay checking notifications or reading replies, to keep my focus.

For now, this will be the most limited functionality Twitter client around. It will only allow me to send a tweet and reply to my own tweets (i.e., thread tweets).
